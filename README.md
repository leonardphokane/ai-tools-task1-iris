Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)
Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn
â€¢	Dataset: Iris Species Dataset
â€¢	Goal:
1.	Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode labels).
2.	Train a decision tree classifier to predict iris species.
3.	Evaluate using accuracy, precision, and recall.
â€¢	Deliverable: Python script/Jupyter notebook with comments explaining each step.
Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch
â€¢	Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits
â€¢	Goal:
1.	Build a CNN model to classify handwritten digits.
2.	Achieve >95% test accuracy.
3.	Visualize the modelâ€™s predictions on 5 sample images.
â€¢	Deliverable: Code with model architecture, training loop, and evaluation.
Task 3: NLP with spaCy
â€¢	Text Data: User reviews from Amazon Product Reviews.
â€¢	Goal:
1.	Perform named entity recognition (NER) to extract product names and brands.
2.	Analyze sentiment (positive/negative) using a rule-based approach.
â€¢	Deliverable: Code snippet and output showing extracted entities and sentiment.

Part 3: Ethics & Optimization (10%)
1. Ethical Considerations
â€¢	Identify potential biases in your MNIST or Amazon Reviews model. How could tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators or spaCyâ€™s rule-based systems mitigate these biases?
2. Troubleshooting Challenge
â€¢	Buggy Code: A provided TensorFlow script has errors (e.g., dimension mismatches, incorrect loss functions). Debug and fix the code.
